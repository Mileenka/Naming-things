/* NAMING CONVENTION FOR CLASSES

It is generally recommended to use PascalCase, also known as UpperCamelCase. 
Here are some guidelines for naming classes:

* Start the class name with an uppercase letter.
* Use descriptive and meaningful names that convey the purpose or responsibility of the class.
* Avoid abbreviations or acronyms unless they are widely known and understood.
* Use nouns or noun phrases for class names to represent objects or concepts.
