/*  When it comes to naming conventions for file names
It is important to choose descriptive names that accurately 
represent the contents or purpose of the file. Here are some guidelines for naming files:

Use lowercase letters for file names.
Separate words within the file name using hyphens ("-") or underscores ("_").
Avoid using spaces or special characters in file names.
Be specific and concise in naming the file to indicate its purpose or content.
Here are some examples demonstrating the naming convention for file names: */

index.html // A file that serves as the main entry point for an HTML-based web application.
styles.css // A file containing the styles (CSS) for a web page or application.
script.js // A file containing JavaScript code for client-side functionality.
my-component.jsx // A file containing a React component written in JSX syntax.
data.json // A file containing structured data in JSON format.
README.md // A file containing documentation or instructions in Markdown format.

/* By following these naming conventions, your file names will be more consistent, 
readable, and easier to understand for yourself and other developers working on the project. 
It also helps with organizing and maintaining a well-structured codebase. */
