/* NO REDUNDANT WORDS

* In clean code, it's important to avoid using redundant words 
that do not contribute additional meaning or clarity to the variable names. 

* Choosing concise and meaningful names helps keep the code clean, 
readable, and less cluttered. 

* It's better to prioritize simplicity and clarity in variable naming, 
using words that directly convey the purpose or nature of the data being represented.

REDUNDANT WORDS
userData, productsList and taskInfo are examples where 
the variable names contain redundant words that do not give any 
additional meaning to the variable name

NO REDUNDANT WORDS

user, products, and task are examples where the variable names 
are already descriptive enough on their own, 
and the inclusion of redundant words causes unnecessary repetition.
